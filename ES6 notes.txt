ES6 Notes:

* Difference of Var and let:

A new keyword called let was introduced in ES6 to solve this potential issue with the var keyword.

ex code: 

var catName;
var quote;
function catTalk() {
  "use strict";

  catName = "Oliver";
  quote = catName + " says Meow!";

}
catTalk();
